# Footer Design with HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates a basic footer design using HTML and CSS.

**Files:**

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the footer.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the footer layout.

**HTML Structure (index.html):**

The HTML code defines the basic structure of the footer, including sections for company information, help links, online shop options, and social media icons.

**CSS Styling (style.css):**

The CSS code styles the footer with the following features:

- Global styles: Sets default styles for body font, line-height, and removes default margin and padding.
- Responsive layout: The footer adjusts its layout based on screen size using media queries.
- Container: Defines a container element with a maximum width centered on the page.
- Footer: Styles the footer section with a background color, padding, and basic responsiveness.
- Footer Columns: Defines styles for each footer column including width, padding, and responsiveness.
- Footer Column Headings (h4): Sets styles for headings within each column like font size, color, and a decorative underline.
- Footer Links: Styles the footer links with font size, color, hover effects, and removes default list styling.
- Social Media Links: Styles the social media icons with size, background color, hover effects, and positioning.

**Features:**

- Uses semantic HTML elements like `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` for better organization.
- Includes social media icons using Font Awesome library.
